# Jack Attack 1999 - browser tests

Playwright scripts that drive the real site in Chromium (uses the system browser at `/usr/bin/chromium`, no download).

    cd tests && PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install

Start a throwaway dev server (never point tests at live data you care about):

    cd app && npm install && PORT=18080 DATA_DIR=/tmp/jhp-test ADMIN_TOKEN=testtoken node server.js

Then run a script with the base URL (or port) it expects, e.g.

    node smoke3.mjs http://localhost:18080     # main areas, desktop + phone
    node integ.mjs 18080                       # the big all-in-one (boot, logon, many programs, fake web)
    node standwake.mjs                         # refresh at the PC then stand up (edit the URL inside)
    node pcmouse.mjs                           # the desktop keeps the mouse after switching on from the room

The in-room monitor regressions accept a throwaway base URL:

    node lean-qa.mjs http://localhost:18080 1366x768
    node lean-qa.mjs http://localhost:18080 1920x1080
    node lean-qa.mjs http://localhost:18080 2560x1080
    node lean-qa.mjs http://localhost:18080 1366x860
    node lean-power.mjs http://localhost:18080  # real power button, guest logon, shutdown, off refresh
    node lean-edges.mjs http://localhost:18080  # pointer-lock ownership, rapid seating, Esc during shutdown
    node bookcase.mjs http://localhost:18080    # isolated media collection, slot returns, disc/case, tidy and refresh
    node shelf-layout.mjs http://localhost:18080 # rearrange, rapid grabs/drops, mid-slide refresh, tidy and separate roaming test profiles
    node tv-background.mjs http://localhost:18080 # Esc continuation, re-entry, background refresh, true stop
    node lighting.mjs http://localhost:18080 review # eight spaces, day/dusk/night, ceiling switch and off-light budget
    node inspect.mjs http://localhost:18080     # same-model inspection, mouse face turns, rotation, refresh
    node handheld.mjs http://localhost:18080    # rear cartridge, stable play pose, Esc and interrupted lift
    node house-review.mjs http://localhost:18080 # eight spaces, stable light sources and aligned car mud
    node art-loading.mjs http://localhost:18080 # cold artwork preparation and transition into the room

Omit the last argument to `lean-qa.mjs` to run all five sizes, including 390x844. Screenshots are saved in `tests/shots/` when run from this directory. These scripts keep the real CSP enabled and use isolated browser storage.

Most print `no errors` / `NO ERRORS` when they pass. Screenshots go in `shots/` (git-ignored).
Some scripts have a hard-coded URL or port near the top: check before running. On the server they are run under
`systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=3G -p MemorySwapMax=0 -q node <script>` to cap memory.
